#the purpose of this script is to act as a wrapper controller to run the prepare_refined_test_params_directories_from_placement_scores_list.py script
#this script will take in an individual file of placement results
#for each placement/file (line) in the file, the smiles of the ligand will be extracted and used to make up to 250 conformers of the ligand with conformator to make params for another round of Rosetta discovery
#this will fire off a job per placement using the helper script to run the preparations. After this, the run rosetta script needs to be run to actually run discovery
#this script will operate in a given location
#it will make numbered folders that hold up to 100 directories for respective ligands
