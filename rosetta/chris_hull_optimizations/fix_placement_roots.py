#the purpose of this script is a post-hoc fix (ideally, only used for the pth2 analysis and I fix before we run discovery again) to fix the paths in the refined conformers compiled files
#the existing paths in these files are the tmp locations where discovery was run, which is not helpful
#this will look down the current location at all raw_scores.csv files and fix the pathing
#as a bonus to fixing the old files, this will also write a compiled file at the working location containing all data in the raw_scores.csv files found
