#the purpose of this script is to be a controller that runs the run_ligand_discovery_search.py script on a database of test_params directories to perform rosetta ligand discovery search
#this script requires the following inputs, some of which require knowledge of how Rosetta reads in the target pdb to know the indices of residues as Rosetta perceives it:
#the script needs the following
#1. target pdb
#2. an anchor residue  string of all positions to be used as anchors, which is comma separated if there is more than 1 (i.e. 79 for 1 or 11,79,55,403 for multiple); this residue needs to use rosetta indexing, which needs to be determined before running the pipeline; for each anchor residue, a unique job will be made to improve runtime and avoid the risk of clobbering placement files (since files from the same ligand have a risk of being clobbered)
#3. a motifs file (by default, will use the main 1.6M motif library, but if another is specified, will be used instead)
#4. a location to look down where there are test_params folders. the script will look down at all test_params folders from the given location

#additional arguments that we will treat as mandatory (5-7)
#score cutoff overrides for fa_atr, fa_rep, and ddg

#an option to bring in a text file containing arguments to be appended to the discovery arguments for things like a space fill region or to print the space fill matrix (not recommended forr memory and speed)
#dimensions and center for a space fill matrix (which can speed up discovery by filtering away placements that are not close enough to the desired binding region)

#by default, this script will try to run individual jobs for up to 7 days. if this really needs to be changed, I can make an option or something, but jobs shouldn't be running for that long anyway
